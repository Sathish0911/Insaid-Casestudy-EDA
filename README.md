**Machine learning is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing it. In the past decade, machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome.**

**WHAT IS MACHINE LEARNING?**
At a very high level, machine learning is the process of teaching a computer system how to make accurate predictions when fed data.
**Machine Learning focuses on the development of computer programs** that can access data and use it to learn for themsleves.  
The process of learning begins with data, such as, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide. **The primary aim is to allow the computers learn automatically** without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.

Machine learning has been widely used in data mining, computer vision, natural language processing, biometrics, search engines, medical diagnostics, detection of credit card fraud, securities market analysis, DNA sequence sequencing, speech and handwriting recognition, strategy games and robotics.

> *The global used car market size was valued at USD 1,332.2 billion in 2019 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR)
> of 5.5% from 2020 to 2027. The inability of customers to buy new cars,
> organised franchisee outlets, ease of financial support,
> certifications, after sales services and warranty have enabled to
> build the confidence of the customers on the used cars.*

 -   Here we try to understand the customer behaviour, buying pattern and demand for the cars.
 - This understanding helps better Inventory management, providing best deals and also for the dealerships to work with financial institutions to provide customised solutions to improve the sales.
