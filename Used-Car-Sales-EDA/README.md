*The global used car market size was valued at USD 1,332.2 billion in 2019 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.5% from 2020 to 2027. 
The inability of customers to buy new cars, organised franchisee outlets, ease of financial support, certifications, after sales services and warranty have enabled to build the confidence of the customers on the used cars.*

 - In this Exploratory data analysis try to understand the relationship between different features, buying pattern and demand for the cars.
 - This understanding helps better Inventory management, providing best deals and also for the dealerships to work with financial institutions to provide customised solutions to improve the sales.
